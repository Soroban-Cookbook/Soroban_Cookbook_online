## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Browse [open issues](https://github.com/Soroban-Cookbook/Soroban-Cookbook-/issues) to see if someone is already working on what you have in mind
2. **Discuss major changes**: Open an issue first for significant changes to discuss the approach
3. **Follow the code of conduct**: Be respectful and constructive in all interactions

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Soroban-Cookbook/Soroban-Cookbook-.git
cd Soroban-Cookbook-

# Install website dependencies
cd website
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Adding a New Pattern

Each pattern should follow this structure:

```
docs/patterns/[category]/[pattern-name].mdx
```

Use this template:

```mdx
---
sidebar_position: [number]
title: [Pattern Name]
description: [Brief description]
---

import PatternCard from '@site/src/components/PatternCard';

<PatternCard metadata={{
  title: "[Pattern Name]",
  description: "[Detailed description]",
  difficulty: "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
  estimatedTime: "[X] min",
  prerequisites: ["Prerequisite 1", "Prerequisite 2"],
  solidityEquivalent: "[Optional: ERC20, etc.]",
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
}}>

### Code Quality Standards

All contract examples must:

1. ✅ **Compile successfully** with the latest stable Soroban SDK
2. ✅ **Include comprehensive tests** with >80% coverage
3. ✅ **Follow Rust best practices** (use clippy and rustfmt)
4. ✅ **Have inline documentation** explaining key concepts
5. ✅ **Include deployment instructions**
6. ✅ **Pass automated CI checks**

### Code Style

**Rust Code:**
```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check lints
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run tests
cargo test
```

**TypeScript/React:**
```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Lint
npm run lint
```

### Commit Message Convention

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
type(scope): Brief description

- Detailed explanation of changes
- Why the change was necessary
- Any breaking changes or migrations needed

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
```

Examples:
```
feat(patterns): Add atomic swap contract example
fix(docs): Correct deployment instructions for testnet
docs(getting-started): Clarify environment setup for Windows
```
